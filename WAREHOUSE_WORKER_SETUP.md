- **Performance tracking**: 7-day productivity chart
- **Quick actions**: Direct access to key operations
- **Safety reminders**: Built-in safety protocols

### 3. **Barcode Scanner Integration**
- **Multi-mode scanning**: General, Pick, Receive, Put Away, Count modes
- **Intelligent processing**: Automatically determines actions based on scanned codes
- **Offline graceful handling**: Works even when scanner is unavailable
- **Haptic feedback**: Vibration on successful scans

### 4. **Task Management**
- **Unified task view**: All task types in one interface
- **Task filtering**: Filter by type, priority, status
- **Task actions**: Start, pause, complete tasks
- **Real-time updates**: Live task status updates

### 5. **Backend API**
- **Complete REST API**: All warehouse worker operations supported
- **Task queues**: Separate queues for different task types
- **Performance analytics**: Historical performance data
- **Quick actions**: Mobile-optimized task completion

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client with new role
cd backend
npx prisma generate

# Run database migration (if needed)
npx prisma db push

# Create demo data
node scripts/createWarehouseWorkerDemo.js
```

### 2. Test Accounts
After running the demo script, you'll have:
- **worker1@warehouse.com** / **worker123** (Pick tasks, Receiving)
- **worker2@warehouse.com** / **worker123** (Put-away, Cycle counting)

### 3. Features to Test
